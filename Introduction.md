# About this project #

This project aims to port the MAVLink based OSD software (MinimOSD) to the hardware of Remzibi's OSD. The advantage of MAVLink based OSD is that it does not need any modification in the APM's software, thus you easily integrate this OSD with APM/ACM, and use the up-to-date APM's software.

# What do I need #
  * A APM 1 or AMP 2 (Otherwise you should use the original Remzibi's OSD)
  * A Remzibi's OSD hardware. (If you don't have one, I suggest you buy a MinimOSD instead. It's cheaper, and has better MCU than Remzibi's)
  * A Serial table (Or a Usb-to-serial adapter)
